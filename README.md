# qandq frontend and backend challenge

Project uses yarn workspaces to manage the frontend and backend
Highly reccomend to use [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) instead of npm.

first run `yarn` to install all dependencies

then

run `yarn start` to start both frontend and backend

OR

### Frontend

cd into frontend folder and run `yarn` to install dependencies
run `yarn start` to start the frontend

## Backend

cd into backend folder and run `yarn` to install dependencies
run `yarn start:dev` to start the backend
